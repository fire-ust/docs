Custom Node Development & Deployment (Java/Scala)
====================================

Fire Insights follows an open and extensible architecture allowing developers to add new custom nodes/processors that can be exposed in Fire UI and embedded into workflows.
 
 
**The details for building new nodes are available at the URL below:**
 
  * https://github.com/sparkflows/writing-new-node
  
**Examples of more complex nodes are at the URL below :**

Step 1 : Start by cloning the github repo: writing-new-node
-----------------------------------------------------

The easiest way to start writing a new node or processor is by cloning the ``writing-new-node`` repo using the command below:

  * git clone https://github.com/sparkflows/writing-new-node.git
  

Step 2 : Install the Fire core jar to the local maven repository
-----------------------------------------------------

Insall the Fire core jar to your local maven repository. The pom.xml contains the dependency for it.

  * mvn install:install-file -Dfile=fire-spark_2.4-core-3.1.0.jar -DgroupId=fire  -DartifactId=fire-spark_2.4-core  -Dversion=3.1.0 -Dpackaging=jar


Step 3 : Code the new custom node
------------------------

The custom node might be a ``Dataset`` node or a ``Transform`` node.

A ``Dataset`` node reads data from some source into a Dataframe. It passes on this new Dataframe to the next node. Examples of data sources include:
  
    * Files on HDFS
    * HIVE tables
    * HBase tables
    * Cassandra
    * MongoDB
    * Salesforce / Marketo


A ``Transform`` node receives an input Dataframe(s), transforms it and sends the transformed Dataframe to the next node.

Writing a Dataset node
++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a new class that extends the ``NodeDataset`` class.

  * Override the ``execute()`` method. The ``execute()`` method will read in data from the defined source into a Dataframe. It would then pass on the resulting DataFrame to output node(s).
  
  * Override the ``getOutputSchema()`` method to return the schema of of the Dataframe created by the node.


Writing a Transform node
++++++++++++++++++++++

Create a new class that extends the ``Node`` class.

  * Override the ``execute()`` method. The ``execute()`` method will ``transform`` the incoming DataFrame and then pass on the resulting DataFrame to output node(s).
  
  * If the node is updating the incoming schema, also override the ``getOutputSchema()`` method. Otherwise the incoming schema to this node is sent to the next node(s).

Step 4 : Create the node JSON file
-------------------------

Create the JSON file for the new node. The JSON file is used for displaying the new node in the ``Workflow Editor`` and capturing the user inputs of the various fields of the node through a ``Dialog box``. The JSON for the node also captures the name of the ``Java/Scala class`` which has the implementation code for the Node.

Fire supports various ``widgets types`` for capturing the details of the fields from the user through the ``Node Dialog Box``. 

Widget Types

The details of the various widget types is available at the URL below:

Examples of Node JSON

* https://github.com/sparkflows/writing-new-node/blob/master/json/nodes/testmovingaverage.json



Step 5 : Deploy the Custom Node in the Fire Server
-----------------------------------------

Now that you have created a new node, follow the steps below to deploy it into the Fire Server:
 
  * Create a jar file with ``mvn clean package``
  * Copy the jar file created in the previous step (target/writing-new-node-3.1.0.jar) into ``fire-user-lib`` directory of Fire Insights.
  * Place the JSON file for the new node under the ``nodes`` directory.
  * ``Restart`` the Fire Server.

The new node would be picked up by the Fire Server and be visible in the ``Workflow Editor``. Check that new node is available as expected in the ``Workflow Editor``.

  
Use the custom node in Spark submit when running on the Spark cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  * Select the custom node jar checkbox when executing the workflow containing the custom node.
  * You can also include the custom node with ``--jars <...>`` when running the workflow on the cluster
