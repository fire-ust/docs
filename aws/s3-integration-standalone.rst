S3 Integration
==========

Fire Insights allows you to access your files on S3. This page describes S3 integration of Fire.

We recommend controlling access to S3 using IAM Roles. 

- Run Fire Insights on an EC2 machine with the appropriate S3 IAM Role.
- Run the EMR cluster with the appropriate S3 IAM Role.

If you are running Fire Insights on a independent machine, you can also use ``aws configure`` to set the AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key on the machine.

AWS CLI S3 Reference : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html

Installing aws cli
---------------

- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
- pip install awscli --upgrade --user

Configuring AWS access key and password
-----------------------------------

Run ``aws configure`` to configure your credentials on the machine on which Fire Insights is running.

   
Access S3 in fire-ui

REFERENCE : Creating Access Key & Secret Key
--------------

1. You'll need create a user with programmatic access by following the steps here (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

 

2. Next, you'll create an IAM policy that defines what this user has access to in your AWS account.  It's important to only grant this user minimal access within your account. See this documentation for how to create IAM policies (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html).

 

3. Finally, you'll create an access key and secret key for this user (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey).

*Note* It's important to regularly rotate your access and secret keys. See this documentation for more information (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#rotating_access_keys_console)
